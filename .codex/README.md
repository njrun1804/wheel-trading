```

## 🚀 **QUICK START**

```bash
# 1. Find optimization opportunities
./.codex/find_optimizations.sh

# 2. Validate environment
./scripts/housekeeping.sh --unity-check

# 3. Run tests to ensure stability
pytest tests/test_wheel.py tests/test_math.py -v

# 4. Make optimizations using patterns from CODEX_GUIDE.md

# 5. Validate changes
./scripts/housekeeping.sh --fix
pytest -v
```

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

✅ **Completed Optimizations:**
- Vectorized strike selection (10x speedup)
- Unified position sizing
- Config-driven ticker references
- Confidence scoring system
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean exception handling
- Unified data models

✅ **Infrastructure:**
- 106+ tests passing (0 failures)
- Symbolic links to real codebase
- Automated housekeeping scripts
- Pre-commit validation
- Performance benchmarking

## 🎯 **YOUR OPTIMIZATION FOCUS**

The major architectural improvements are complete. Focus on:

1. **Micro-optimizations**: Small performance improvements
2. **Code Quality**: Any remaining code smells
3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced recovery strategies
4. **Memory Usage**: Optimization for large datasets
5. **New Features**: Additional functionality

## 💡 **HOW TO CONTRIBUTE**

1. **Read**: `CODEX_GUIDE.md` for patterns and best practices
2. **Assess**: `CURRENT_STATE.md` to avoid duplicate work
3. **Find**: Run `find_optimizations.sh` to identify targets
4. **Optimize**: Apply improvements using established patterns
5. **Validate**: Use housekeeping scripts and tests
6. **Commit**: Use automated workflow scripts

## 🛡️ **SAFETY CONSTRAINTS**

- ❌ Never add trade execution code
- ✅ Always return confidence scores from calculations
- ✅ Use config values instead of hardcoded constants
- ✅ Keep tests passing at all times
- ✅ Follow file placement rules

## 📚 **FULL DOCUMENTATION**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Complete development guide (600+ lines)
- `HOUSEKEEPING_GUIDE.md` - File organization rules
