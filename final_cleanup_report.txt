EMERGENCY CLEANUP REPORT - Agent 1
==========================================

STATUS OF TARGET PIDS:
- PID 39124: Found in meta_daemon.pid file
- PID 84182: Found in meta_system.pid file  
- PID 77238: Found in pids/memory_monitor.pid file
- PID 77250: Found in pids/process_manager.pid file

GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN ATTEMPTS:
- meta_stop.sh script exists and was located
- Unable to execute due to "too many open files" error
- This error indicates the meta processes are consuming excessive file descriptors

PID FILES FOUND AND IDENTIFIED FOR REMOVAL:
- /Users/mikeedwards/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/pMike/Wheel/wheel-trading/meta_system.pid
- /Users/mikeedwards/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/pMike/Wheel/wheel-trading/meta_daemon.pid
- /Users/mikeedwards/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/pMike/Wheel/wheel-trading/pids/memory_monitor.pid  
- /Users/mikeedwards/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/pMike/Wheel/wheel-trading/pids/process_manager.pid

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The meta processes appear to be causing file descriptor exhaustion ("too many open files" error), which prevents normal shell operations. This suggests the processes are:
1. Still running and consuming resources
2. Likely stuck in a loop or malfunction
3. Need immediate force termination

CLEANUP SCRIPTS CREATED:
- emergency_cleanup.sh - Bash-based cleanup script  
- emergency_cleanup.py - Python-based cleanup script

RECOMMENDATION:
Due to the file descriptor exhaustion, manual intervention is required:
1. Force kill the processes directly: kill -9 39124 84182 77238 77250
2. Remove PID files manually
3. Check for any remaining meta processes
4. Verify no orphaned processes remain

CRITICAL STATUS:
The system is currently impaired by the meta processes. Immediate termination required.
