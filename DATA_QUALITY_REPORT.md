# Data Quality Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUES DETECTED**

The comprehensive assessment reveals significant data quality problems that would severely impact the wheel trading system's reliability. The most concerning finding is that **61.3% of Unity options data shows synthetic patterns**, with 135,058 duplicate entries.

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Structure
- **7 tables** found in DuckDB
- **Only 2 tables have data**:
  - `unity_options_ohlcv`: 1,040,215 records
  - `opra_symbology`: 759,994 records
- **5 tables are empty**: greeks_cache, option_chains, options_data, position_snapshots, predictions_cache

### 2. Unity Options Data Issues

#### Duplicates (CRITICAL)
- **135,058 duplicate symbol/date combinations**
- Example: Symbol `U260116P00065000` on 2025-02-24 has **95 duplicate entries** with different prices
- This suggests data was loaded multiple times or from multiple sources without deduplication

#### Synthetic Data Patterns (CRITICAL)
- **61.3% of records show synthetic patterns**:
  - Open = Close (suggesting no intraday movement)
  - Volume in exact multiples of 100
  - High - Low = exactly 0.01
- **714 prices appear more than 100 times** (highly unusual for options)

#### Price Anomalies
From the partial output, we can see:
- Same option, same date, wildly different prices:
  - Low: 0.60, High: 3.60
  - This 6x price difference on the same day for the same option is impossible

### 3. Missing Critical Data
- **No Unity stock price history** (table exists but empty)
- **No Greeks calculations** (greeks_cache empty)
- **No position data** (position_snapshots empty)
- **No FRED data** found in database

### 4. Data Source Concerns

The data appears to be:
1. **Incorrectly imported** - Multiple loads of the same data without deduplication
2. **Possibly synthetic** - The patterns suggest this might be test data or incorrectly generated data
3. **Not production-ready** - Cannot be used for real trading decisions

## Impact Assessment

### Cannot Support Production Use
- **Duplicate data** would cause incorrect position calculations
- **Synthetic patterns** would lead to unrealistic risk assessments
- **Missing stock data** prevents Greeks calculations
- **Price anomalies** would result in wrong trading decisions

### Specific Risks
1. **Position Sizing**: Duplicates would multiply position calculations
2. **Risk Metrics**: VaR/CVaR calculations would be meaningless
3. **Option Selection**: Cannot identify optimal strikes with bad data
4. **Backtesting**: Results would be completely unreliable

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues suggest:
1. **Import process failed** - The ETL loaded data multiple times
2. **No data validation** - Basic checks (duplicates, price bounds) not performed
3. **Wrong data source** - This might be test/sample data, not real market data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **DO NOT USE THIS DATA FOR TRADING**
   - The data quality issues make it unsuitable for any production use

2. **Re-import Unity Options Data**
   ```sql
   -- First, backup existing data
   CREATE TABLE unity_options_backup AS SELECT * FROM unity_options_ohlcv;

   -- Clear the table
   DELETE FROM unity_options_ohlcv;

   -- Re-run import with deduplication
   ```

3. **Implement Data Validation**
   - Check for duplicates before inserting
   - Validate price relationships (0 < Low ≤ Open, Close ≤ High)
   - Ensure put premiums < strike price
   - Verify reasonable price changes between days

4. **Add Missing Data Sources**
   - Import Unity stock price history
   - Pull current FRED data
   - Calculate and cache Greeks

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Data Pipeline Improvements**
   - Add duplicate detection in ETL
   - Implement price validation rules
   - Create data quality monitoring

2. **Alternative Data Sources**
   - Consider getting data directly from Databento API
   - Validate against multiple sources
   - Use only production-grade data feeds

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Create known test cases
   - Validate calculations against expected results
   - Monitor data quality metrics

## Conclusion

The current data is **NOT suitable for production use**. The combination of massive duplicates, synthetic patterns, and missing critical data makes this database dangerous for real trading decisions.

**Recommendation**: Start fresh with a clean import, proper validation, and production-quality data sources.
