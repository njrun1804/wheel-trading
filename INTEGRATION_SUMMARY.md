# Integration Summary: Advanced Financial Modeling

## ✅ COMPLETE INTEGRATION

All requested financial modeling features have been implemented and integrated into the Unity Wheel Trading Bot.

### 1. **Borrowing Cost Analysis** ✅
- Pure mathematical calculations (no safety factors)
- Tax-free environment
- Amex loan: $45k @ 7% APR
- Schwab margin: 10% APR
- Daily compounding for accuracy
- **Integration**: `WheelAdvisor` analyzes borrowing before position sizing

### 2. **Unity Margin Calculator** ✅
- IRA accounts: 100% cash secured
- Margin accounts: Standard formula with 1.5x Unity adjustment
- Portfolio margin: Risk-based with Unity multiplier
- **Integration**: Used in `DynamicPositionSizer` for all positions

### 3. **Monte Carlo Simulation** ✅
- 1,000+ simulations per decision
- Student-t distribution for Unity's fat tails
- Path-dependent modeling available
- Confidence intervals and percentiles
- **Integration**: Runs automatically in `advise_position()`

### 4. **Risk-Adjusted Metrics** ✅
- Sharpe/Sortino ratios with borrowing costs
- Calmar ratio (return/max drawdown)
- Information, Treynor, and Omega ratios
- Adjusted versions accounting for leverage
- **Integration**: Calculated for all recommendations

### 5. **Advanced Features** ✅
- **Optimal Capital Structure**: Find ideal leverage ratio
- **Multi-Period Optimization**: Plan borrowing over time
- **Correlation Analysis**: Unity returns vs interest rates
- **VaR with Leverage**: Value at Risk with borrowed capital

## How It's Integrated

### Decision Flow
```
Market Data → WheelAdvisor
    ↓
Strike Selection
    ↓
Borrowing Analysis ← NEW: Should we borrow?
    ↓
Position Sizing (limited by borrowing)
    ↓
Monte Carlo Simulation ← NEW: 1,000 simulations
    ↓
Risk Metrics (enhanced) ← NEW: Includes all advanced metrics
    ↓
Final Recommendation
```

### Key Code Changes

1. **WheelAdvisor** (`src/unity_wheel/api/advisor.py`)
   - Added `borrowing_analyzer` and `financial_modeler`
   - Borrowing analysis before position sizing
   - Monte Carlo simulation for all recommendations
   - Enhanced risk metrics in output

2. **WheelStrategy** (`src/unity_wheel/strategy/wheel.py`)
   - `calculate_position_size()` accepts `max_contracts` from borrowing analysis
   - Real option prices required (no placeholders)

3. **DynamicPositionSizer** (`src/unity_wheel/utils/position_sizing.py`)
   - Integrated `UnityMarginCalculator`
   - Account type differentiation
   - Accurate margin requirements

4. **Risk Module** (`src/unity_wheel/risk/`)
   - `borrowing_cost_analyzer.py` - Pure math borrowing analysis
   - `unity_margin.py` - Unity-specific margin calculations
   - `advanced_financial_modeling.py` - Monte Carlo, VaR, optimization
   - `pure_borrowing_analyzer.py` - NPV/IRR calculations

## Usage

### Run with Full Integration
```bash
python run.py --portfolio 100000

# Output includes:
# - Borrowing recommendation
# - Monte Carlo confidence intervals
# - Risk-adjusted metrics
# - Leverage impact analysis
```

### Example Output Structure
```python
recommendation = {
    "risk": {
        "borrowing_analysis": {
            "action": "invest",
            "hurdle_rate": 0.07,

            "expected_shortfall": -0.22
        },
        # Plus standard risk metrics
    },
    "details": {
        "borrowing_recommended": True,
