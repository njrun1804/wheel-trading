print("Evidence:")
print("1. TransformerEncoder (heavy PyTorch init) → hang")
print("2. Path() in async context → hang")
print("3. ProcessPoolExecutor → pickle errors")
print("4. LMDB writemap → segfaults")
print("5. Timeouts not firing → event loop blocked")

print("\nROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:")
print("PyTorch/neural network initialization is blocking the event loop")
print("because it's doing heavy CPU work during module import/init.")

print("\nSOLUTION APPROACHES:")
print("1. Lazy initialization - defer heavy work until first use")
print("2. Synchronous pre-initialization - do heavy work before async")
print("3. Thread-based initialization - run in separate thread")
print("4. Simplified components - remove heavy dependencies")
