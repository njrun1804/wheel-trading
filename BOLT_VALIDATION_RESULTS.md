```python
from bolt.real_world_validation import validate_m4_pro_production_readiness

# Run comprehensive validation
result = await validate_m4_pro_production_readiness()
print(result["production_assessment"]["recommendation"])
```

### Troubleshooting
- All async/await issues have been resolved
- Robust fallback mechanisms ensure continued operation
- Production error recovery provides automatic fault tolerance
