# Jarvis 2.0 - M4 Pro Personal Trading Code Assistant

## Vision Realized
A personal AI that learns YOUR coding patterns, optimizes for YOUR M4 Pro hardware, and becomes your expert pair programmer for wheel trading strategies.

## Core Architecture for M4 Pro (Serial: KXQ93HN7DP)

### Hardware Utilization Strategy
```
8 P-cores: Parallel MCTS exploration (1000s of code variants)
4 E-cores: Background learning & index maintenance  
16 GPU cores: Neural evaluation & vector similarity
24GB RAM: 20GB for Jarvis (indexes, models, experience)
```

       return await gpu_calc.batch_greeks(
           positions,
           interest_rate=CURRENT_RISK_FREE,  # Auto-pulled from FRED
           dividend_yield=SPY_DIVIDEND_YIELD  # Cached from your data
       )
   ```

2. Vectorized NumPy (ðŸ”¥ 18x faster)
   [Shows NumPy implementation]

3. Parallel CPU (âš¡ 8x faster)
   [Shows multiprocessing implementation]

ðŸ’¡ Learned: You prefer GPU solutions for batches >100 positions

Which implementation? (1/2/3/custom): 1
