## Conclusion

The Wheel Trading system demonstrates excellent architectural design and outstanding performance capabilities, particularly with hardware acceleration showing 10.8x improvements. However, critical issues in the authentication system, database layer, and some performance edge cases must be addressed before production deployment.

The system shows tremendous potential and with the identified fixes, should achieve production readiness within 3-4 weeks. The investment in hardware optimization and modular architecture positions the system well for future scalability and maintenance.

**Recommendation:** Focus on the critical fixes first, then proceed with gradual deployment testing once auth and database issues are resolved.
