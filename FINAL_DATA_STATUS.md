# Final Unity Data Status Report

## Summary
**ALL DATA IS REAL** - No synthetic data exists in the database.

## ✅ What You Have

### Stock Data (COMPLETE)
- **861 trading days** of Unity daily stock data
- **Date range**: January 3, 2022 to June 9, 2025
- **Latest close**: $24.69 on June 9, 2025
- **Table**: `price_history`
- **Fields**: date, open, high, low, close, volume

### Options Data (INCOMPLETE)
- **206,236 tick records** from March 28, 2023
- **BUT**: Symbol field is empty for all records
- **Issue**: Download didn't capture option symbols properly
- **Result**: Cannot identify which strikes/expirations

## 📊 Usable Data

You can use the Unity stock data immediately:

```sql
-- Get Unity daily prices
SELECT date, open, high, low, close, volume
FROM price_history
WHERE symbol = 'U'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## ❌ Options Data Issue

The options download captured timestamps and instrument IDs but not the human-readable symbols. This makes the data unusable for identifying specific strikes and expirations.

## 🚀 Next Steps

To get usable Unity options data, you would need to:

1. **Re-download with proper symbol mapping**, or
2. **Use a different data source** that provides complete option chains
3. **Map instrument IDs to symbols** using Databento's symbology API

## 🔒 Data Integrity

- ✅ All synthetic data generators have been **permanently deleted**
- ✅ Database contains **only real market data**
- ✅ Stock data is **complete and ready to use**
- ⚠️ Options data needs proper symbol mapping to be useful

---

**Bottom Line**: You have 3.5 years of real Unity stock data ready to use. The options data exists but needs symbol mapping to be useful.
