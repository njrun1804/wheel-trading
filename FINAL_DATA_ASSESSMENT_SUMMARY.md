# Final Data Quality Assessment Summary

## üö® CRITICAL ALERT: DO NOT USE THIS DATA

### Assessment Complete
After comprehensive analysis of all data sources, the findings are catastrophic:

## Key Findings

### 1. Unity Options Data (1,040,215 rows)
- **82.8% are duplicates** (861,491 duplicate rows)
- Each option/date has average **5.8 duplicate entries**
- Same option shows wildly different prices on same date
- Example: `U260116P00065000` on 2025-02-24 has 95 different price entries

### 2. Data Quality Issues
- **58.3% show synthetic patterns** (open = close)
- Duplicates exist in source parquet file (not a loading issue)
- The ETL process fundamentally failed

### 3. Missing Critical Data
- ‚ùå Unity stock prices (empty table)
- ‚ùå Greeks calculations (empty table)
- ‚ùå FRED economic data (no table)
- ‚ùå Position data (empty table)
- ‚ùå Options chains (empty table)

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
The issue originates in the ETL process (`unity_options_etl.py`):
1. **Multiple data loads** - Same data imported multiple times
2. **No deduplication** - Duplicate rows not detected or removed
3. **No validation** - Invalid data patterns not caught
4. **Wrong aggregation** - Multiple intraday prices treated as separate daily records

## Impact Analysis

### If Used for Trading:
- **Position sizing**: Off by ~6x due to duplicates
- **Risk calculations**: Meaningless with duplicate/synthetic data
- **Option selection**: Would select from phantom strikes
- **Backtesting**: Results would be completely invalid

### Specific Examples:
- A $10,000 position would be calculated as $58,000
- Risk metrics would show 6x lower risk than reality
- Backtests would show false profitable trades

## Data Source Verification

Checked `data/unity-options/processed/unity_ohlcv_3y.parquet`:
- Parquet file itself contains duplicates
- Not a database loading issue
- Problem originated during ETL from raw data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **DELETE ALL DATA** - It's irreparably corrupted
2. **DO NOT USE** for any purpose
3. **Alert all users** who may have accessed this data

### To Fix:
1. **New ETL Implementation**
   - One record per symbol/date
   - Aggregate intraday data properly (OHLC)
   - Validate all price relationships
   - Detect and prevent duplicates

2. **Data Validation Requirements**
   - Unique constraint on (symbol, date)
   - Price validation: 0 < Low ‚â§ Open, Close ‚â§ High
   - Put premium < Strike price
   - Volume ‚â• 0

3. **Missing Data**
   - Import Unity stock prices from reliable source
   - Pull FRED data for risk-free rates
   - Calculate and cache Greeks

## Summary
**This is not a minor data quality issue - this is a complete data failure.**

The presence of 82.8% duplicates with different prices for the same option/date combination indicates either:
1. The raw data source is corrupted
2. The ETL process is fundamentally broken
3. Test/synthetic data was imported instead of real data

**Under no circumstances should this data be used for trading decisions.**
