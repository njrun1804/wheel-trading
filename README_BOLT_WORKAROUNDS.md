# Bolt Workarounds - Practical Solutions for Broken Functionality

This document provides comprehensive workarounds for the critical issues preventing bolt from functioning in production. These solutions bypass the broken layers and provide immediate functionality.

## Quick Start

For immediate functionality, use the complete bypass system:

```bash
# Test the bypass system
python bolt_integration_bypass.py "optimize wheel strategy performance"

# Analyze database issues
python bolt_integration_bypass.py "analyze database performance"

# Code analysis without broken search
python bolt_integration_bypass.py "debug memory issues in trading code"
```

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. AsyncIO Subprocess Failures
**Problem**: `NotImplementedError: asyncio child watcher not implemented`
**Impact**: Breaks all search functionality (ripgrep, dependency analysis)

**Workaround**: Use synchronous subprocess execution with proper fallbacks
```python
from bolt_workarounds import WorkaroundRipgrep

# Direct search bypassing asyncio issues
ripgrep = WorkaroundRipgrep()
results = ripgrep.search_sync("wheel strategy", "src/")
```

### 2. Database Concurrency Issues
**Problem**: `Could not set lock on analytics.db: Conflicting lock is held`
**Impact**: Prevents multiple sessions and Einstein integration

**Workaround**: Advanced connection pooling with file-based locking
```python
from bolt_database_fixes import ConcurrentDatabase

# Thread-safe database access
db = ConcurrentDatabase("data/analytics.db")
with db.connection() as conn:
    results = db.query("SELECT * FROM trades")
```

### 3. Einstein Search Failures
**Problem**: Complex ML dependencies fail to initialize
**Impact**: No semantic search capabilities

**Workaround**: TF-IDF based fallback with domain awareness
```python
from bolt_einstein_fallbacks import EinsteinFallback

fallback = EinsteinFallback(".")
await fallback.initialize()
results = await fallback.search("wheel strategy optimization")
```

## Available Workaround Modules

### 1. `bolt_workarounds.py` - Complete System Replacement

```

## Integration with Existing Code

### Replace Broken Bolt Calls
```python
# Instead of broken bolt.solve()
# result = await bolt.solve("optimize performance")

# Use bypass system
from bolt_integration_bypass import BoltBypassSystem
bypass = BoltBypassSystem()
await bypass.initialize()
result = await bypass.solve("optimize performance")
```

### Replace Einstein Search
```python
# Instead of broken Einstein
# results = await einstein.search("query")

# Use fallback
from bolt_einstein_fallbacks import EinsteinFallback
fallback = EinsteinFallback(".")
await fallback.initialize()
results = await fallback.search("query")
```

### Replace Database Access
```python
# Instead of broken database access
# conn = get_database_connection("analytics.db")

# Use concurrent database
from bolt_database_fixes import ConcurrentDatabase
db = ConcurrentDatabase("analytics.db")
with db.connection() as conn:
    # Use connection safely
    pass
```

## Performance Characteristics

## Trading Domain Features

### Wheel Strategy Analysis
```python
from bolt_direct_tools import DirectTradingAnalyzer

analyzer = DirectTradingAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_wheel_strategy()

print(f"Found {len(result.findings)} wheel strategy insights")
for finding in result.findings:
    print(f"  • {finding}")
```

### Options Pricing Analysis
```python
result = analyzer.analyze_options_pricing()
print("Options pricing analysis:")
for rec in result.recommendations:
    print(f"  • {rec}")
```

### Risk Management Analysis
```python
result = analyzer.analyze_risk_management()
print(f"Risk analysis completed in {result.execution_time:.2f}s")
```

## Error Recovery

### Automatic Fallbacks
The workaround systems implement multi-level fallbacks:

1. **Primary**: Try fastest/best method
2. **Secondary**: Fall back to slower but reliable method  
3. **Tertiary**: Use basic but guaranteed method

### Example Fallback Chain for Search:
1. Ripgrep with asyncio fixes
2. Synchronous ripgrep
3. System grep
4. Python-based text search

### Database Recovery:
1. Use connection pool
2. Direct connection with retries
3. Read-only access if locks fail
4. Graceful degradation

## Debugging and Diagnostics

### Enable Debug Logging
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# All workaround modules will provide detailed logs
```

### System Health Check
```python
from bolt_integration_bypass import BoltBypassSystem

bypass = BoltBypassSystem()
await bypass.initialize()
stats = bypass.get_system_stats()
print(f"System health: {stats}")
```

### Database Diagnostics
```bash
# Check all databases in project
python bolt_database_fixes.py fix .

# Get detailed lock information
python bolt_database_fixes.py info data/analytics.db
```

## Production Deployment

### Recommended Setup
1. Use `bolt_integration_bypass.py` as primary interface
2. Configure database connection pooling
3. Enable Einstein fallback for semantic search
4. Set up monitoring for performance tracking

### Configuration
```python
# Production configuration
bypass = BoltBypassSystem(
    project_root="/path/to/trading/system",
)

# Configure database with higher limits
db_config = {
    'max_connections': 20,
    'connection_timeout': 60.0,
    'enable_wal_mode': True
}
```

### Monitoring
```python
# Track performance
stats = bypass.get_system_stats()
if stats['average_query_time'] > 5.0:
    logger.warning("Query performance degraded")
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Replace Critical Failures
1. Replace broken search with `WorkaroundRipgrep`
2. Fix database access with `ConcurrentDatabase`
3. Add Einstein fallback for semantic search

### Phase 2: Full Bypass Integration
1. Deploy `BoltBypassSystem` as primary interface
2. Route all queries through bypass system
3. Monitor performance and adjust

### Phase 3: Gradual Restoration
1. Fix underlying bolt issues
2. A/B test bolt vs bypass performance
3. Migrate back to bolt when stable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Search Returns No Results**:
```python
# Check if ripgrep is installed
import subprocess
try:
    subprocess.run(["rg", "--version"], check=True)
    print("Ripgrep available")
except:
    print("Install ripgrep: brew install ripgrep")
```

**Database Lock Errors**:
```bash
# Force unlock all databases
python bolt_database_fixes.py fix .

# Check for zombie processes
ps aux | grep python | grep wheel-trading
```

**Memory Issues**:
```python
# Use direct tools for memory-efficient operation
from bolt_direct_tools import direct_solve
result = direct_solve("your query")  # Uses <50MB
```

**Performance Problems**:
```python
# Profile query execution
import time
start = time.time()
result = await bypass.solve("query")
print(f"Query took {time.time() - start:.2f}s")
```
