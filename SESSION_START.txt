### UNITY WHEEL v2.2 — PRE-TASK CHECKS

**RUN FIRST (2 sec):**
```bash
./scripts/housekeeping.sh --unity-check
```
✓ Checks: No execution code, adaptive system exists, Unity config

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. NO TRADING EXECUTION (recommendations only)
2. Every data function returns `(result, confidence_score)`
3. Unity ticker from `config.unity.ticker` only (line 238)
4. Files: `test_*.py` → `tests/`, `adaptive_*.py` → `src/unity_wheel/adaptive/`

**COMMIT GATE:**
```bash
./scripts/housekeeping.sh --check-staged || exit 1
```
See HOUSEKEEPING_GUIDE.md#agent-quick-start for a quick summary.
