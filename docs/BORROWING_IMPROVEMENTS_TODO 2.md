# Borrowing Cost Analysis - Future Improvements

## Current Implementation âœ…
- Pure mathematical calculations (no safety factors)
- Tax-free environment
- Daily compounding interest
- NPV and IRR calculations
- Break-even analysis
- Sensitivity analysis
- Opportunity cost calculations

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Real-Time Integration
- Connect to broker APIs for current margin rates
- Dynamic rate updates based on Fed funds rate
- Account balance integration
- Real-time position tracking

### 2. Advanced Financial Modeling
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Model uncertainty in returns
- **Optimal Capital Structure**: Find ideal debt/equity mix
- **Multi-Period Optimization**: Plan borrowing over multiple trades
- **Correlation Analysis**: How Unity returns correlate with interest rates

### 3. Risk-Adjusted Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio** with borrowing costs included
- **Sortino Ratio** for downside risk
- **Maximum Drawdown** analysis with leverage
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** with borrowed capital

### 4. Tax Integration (When Needed)
- Toggle for tax-free vs taxable accounts
- State-specific tax calculations
- Short-term vs long-term capital gains
- Interest deduction modeling

### 5. Portfolio-Wide Analysis
- Multiple position optimization
- Cross-margining benefits
- Diversification impact on borrowing capacity
- Portfolio margin vs Reg T calculations

### 6. Advanced Loan Features
- Variable rate modeling
- Prepayment penalties
- Loan amortization schedules
- Multiple currency support

### 7. Machine Learning Integration
- Predict optimal borrowing times
- Learn from historical decisions
- Personalized risk tolerance calibration
- Market regime detection for rate changes

### 8. Reporting & Visualization
- Interactive dashboards
- Historical performance tracking
- What-if scenario modeling
- PDF report generation

### 9. Behavioral Finance
- Track actual vs planned decisions
- Measure discipline in following math
- Alert on emotional decision patterns
- Gamification of debt paydown

### 10. Integration Features
- Quicken/Mint integration
- Spreadsheet export/import
- API for other tools
- Mobile app notifications

## Implementation Priority
