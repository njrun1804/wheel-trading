# Pull-When-Asked Architecture Migration Summary

## Overview

The Unity Wheel Trading Bot has been successfully migrated from a continuous monitoring/streaming architecture to a lean "pull-when-asked" model. This document summarizes all changes made to align with the new architecture.

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before (v1.0)
- Continuous background synchronization
- Streaming WebSocket connections
- Multiple storage backends (SQLite, Firestore, BigQuery)
- Always-running monitoring daemons
- Complex infrastructure with high operational overhead

### After (v2.0)
- On-demand data fetching only
- REST APIs only (no WebSocket)
- Single storage layer (DuckDB only)
- Zero background processes
- Simple, cost-effective infrastructure

## Storage Migration

### New Storage Components

1. **DuckDB Local Cache** (`src/unity_wheel/storage/duckdb_cache.py`)
   - Primary storage for all data types
   - 30-day TTL with automatic cleanup
   - SQL interface for complex queries
   - < 5GB typical disk usage

3. **Unified Storage** (`src/unity_wheel/storage/storage.py`)
   - Single `get_or_fetch` pattern for all data
   - Transparent caching with configurable TTLs
   - Automatic fallback to cached data on API failures

### Removed Components
- ❌ SQLite databases (replaced by DuckDB)
- ❌ Firestore (not needed)
- ❌ BigQuery (not needed)
- ❌ Bigtable (not needed)
- ❌ Continuous sync modules

## Module Updates

### 1. Schwab Integration
- **Removed**: `data_ingestion.py` (continuous sync)
- **Added**: `data_fetcher.py` (simple on-demand fetching)
- **Updated**: All references to use new fetcher

### 2. Databento Integration
- **Removed**: WebSocket/streaming references
- **Updated**: REST-only client
- **Added**: Aggressive strike filtering (±20% of spot)

### 3. Monitoring & Observability
- **Removed**: `monitor.sh` continuous loop
- **Added**: `health_check.sh` for on-demand checks
- **Updated**: Dashboard to use DuckDB

### 4. Entry Points
- **Added**: `run_on_demand.py` - New main entry point
- **Added**: Cloud Run Job configuration
- **Updated**: All examples to show pull-when-asked pattern

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
1. **README.md** - Complete rewrite for pull-when-asked
2. **SCHWAB_DATA_COLLECTION.md** - On-demand pattern
3. **DATABENTO_INTEGRATION.md** - REST-only, no streaming
4. **STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md** - New unified storage design

### New Documentation
1. **PULL_WHEN_ASKED_MIGRATION.md** - This file
2. **cloud_run_job.yaml** - Serverless deployment
3. **Dockerfile.job** - Minimal container

## Configuration Changes

### config.yaml
- No changes to structure
- Storage paths now point to DuckDB
- Removed streaming/continuous sync settings

### Environment Variables
- Same pattern: `WHEEL_SECTION__PARAM`
- Credentials use SecretManager

## Cost Impact

### Monthly Cost Comparison

| Component | Before (v1.0) | After (v2.0) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Compute | $50-100 (always on) | < $5 (on demand) |
| Storage | $20-50 (multiple DBs) | < $10 (DuckDB only) |
| APIs | $100+ (streaming) | < $40 (cached REST) |
| **Total** | **$170-250** | **< $55** |

## Migration Steps for Existing Users

1. **Update Code**
   ```bash
   git pull
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Migrate Credentials**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup-secrets.py
   ```

3. **Test New Architecture**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   ./scripts/health_check.sh

   # Get recommendation
   python run_on_demand.py --portfolio 100000
   ```

4. **Remove Old Components**
   ```bash
   # Stop any running monitors
   pkill -f monitor.sh

   # Remove old SQLite databases (optional)
   rm ~/.wheel_trading/*.db
   ```

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplicity** - No background processes to manage
2. **Cost** - 70%+ reduction in operational costs
3. **Reliability** - Fewer moving parts = fewer failures
4. **Performance** - Local cache provides instant responses
5. **Maintenance** - Self-managing with automatic cleanup

## Breaking Changes

1. **No Continuous Monitoring** - Use cron for periodic checks
2. **No Streaming Data** - All data is fetched on demand
3. **New Entry Point** - Use `run_on_demand.py` instead of `run.py`
4. **Storage Location** - Data now in `~/.wheel_trading/cache/`

## Future Considerations

The pull-when-asked architecture is designed for:
- Single-user operation
- Recommendation-only (no execution)
- Cost efficiency over real-time updates

If requirements change to need real-time data or multi-user support, the architecture would need significant updates.

## Support

For questions or issues with the migration:
1. Check the updated documentation
2. Run `./scripts/health_check.sh` for diagnostics
3. Open an issue on GitHub with details

Migration completed successfully. The system is now operating in pull-when-asked mode with significant cost savings and operational simplicity.
