# Current Status - Unity Wheel Trading Bot

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- Secret management system (local encrypted storage)
- FRED API integration
- Databento API integration (when configured)
- Options math calculations (Black-Scholes, Greeks, IV)
- Risk analytics (VaR, CVaR, Kelly criterion)
- Manual position entry system

## ‚ùå What's Broken
- Schwab OAuth authentication
  - App shows "Ready For Use" but returns "invalid_client"
  - Cannot delete the broken app
  - Cannot create a new app (1 app limit)
  - Cannot regenerate the secret

## üîß Workaround Available

Edit `my_positions.yaml` with your positions:
```yaml
account:
  cash: 50000.00  # Your cash balance

positions:
  stocks:
    - symbol: "AAPL"
      quantity: 100
      cost_basis: 220.50

  options:
    - symbol: "AAPL"
      position_type: "covered_call"
      strike: 230
      expiry: "2025-07-18"
      quantity: -1
      premium_collected: 3.50
      underlying_symbol: "AAPL"
```

Then run:
```bash
python get_recommendation.py
```

## üìß Next Steps

1. **Contact Schwab Support**
   - Email: developer@schwab.com
   - Use the template in `URGENT_SCHWAB_SUPPORT.md`
   - Or call: 1-800-435-4000 (ask for developer support)

2. **Use Manual System**
   - Update `my_positions.yaml` with your trades
   - Get recommendations with `python get_recommendation.py`

3. **Other Tools Still Available**
   ```bash
   # Calculate option Greeks
   python run.py --calculate-greeks AAPL 225 230 30 0.25

   # Risk analytics examples
   python example_risk_analytics.py
   ```

## üéØ Resolution
This is a Schwab platform bug. Only they can fix it by either:
- Repairing your app registration in their backend
- Allowing you to delete and recreate the app
- Temporarily increasing your app limit

The manual position system will work until Schwab fixes the issue.
