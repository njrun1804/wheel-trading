# Unity Wheel Trading Bot v2.0 - Autonomous Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Shell Scripts for Autonomous Operation
All shell scripts have been created and are executable:
- `scripts/autonomous-checks.sh` - Comprehensive system validation
- `scripts/monitor.sh` - Continuous monitoring daemon
- `scripts/maintenance.sh` - Periodic cleanup tasks

### 2. Git Pre-commit Hooks
The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` has been updated with:
- Standard code quality checks
- System diagnostics on push
- Configuration validation
- Feature flag health checks

### 3. Documentation Updates
All documentation has been updated for v2.0:
- **README.md** - Updated with v2.0 features
- **CLAUDE.md** - Updated with new commands and NO BROKER note
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Created for v1.x to v2.0 migration
- **AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS.md** - Complete guide to autonomous features
- **DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Overview of all documentation
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick command reference

### 4. Import Issues Fixed
Several import issues were resolved:
- Fixed `unity_wheel` imports to use `src.unity_wheel`
- Fixed Pydantic v2 syntax issues
- Fixed date field name clash in fred_models.py
- Fixed StructuredLogger initialization

## üöß Known Issues

1. **MetricsCollector.get_statistics()** - Method not implemented
   - Affects: `python run.py --export-metrics`
   - Workaround: Other autonomous features work correctly

2. **StructuredLogger Initialization** - Some modules still have incorrect initialization
   - Affects: Logging in some modules
   - Workaround: Core diagnostics work correctly

## üéØ Quick Verification

Run these commands to verify the setup:

```bash
# Check diagnostics work
python run.py --diagnose

# Check version
python run.py --version

# Test autonomous checks (partial - will error on metrics export)
./scripts/autonomous-checks.sh

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## üìã Summary

The autonomous operation infrastructure is in place:
- ‚úÖ Shell scripts created and executable
- ‚úÖ Git hooks configured
- ‚úÖ All documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Core diagnostics working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some features need additional implementation

The system is ready for autonomous operation as a **recommendation-only** bot (no broker integration).
