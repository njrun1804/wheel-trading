# URGENT: Contact Schwab Developer Support

You're experiencing a critical platform bug that only Schwab can fix.

## The Problem
1. Your app is broken after deactivate/reactivate
2. You cannot delete the broken app
3. You cannot create a new app (1 app limit)
4. You cannot regenerate the secret
5. OAuth returns "invalid_client" with correct credentials

## Contact Schwab Immediately

**Subject: URGENT - App Broken, Cannot Delete or Create New App**

**Message:**
```
I have a critical issue that has completely blocked my API access:

App Name: Github1
App Key: OB1E7lHclAbxMCFplibjuDvQlOnmwkEN
Issue: Multiple platform failures

1. My app was working fine until today when I deactivated and reactivated it
2. Now OAuth returns "invalid_client" even with correct credentials
3. I cannot deactivate/delete the broken app - the system won't allow it
4. I cannot create a new app - it says I've reached the 1 app limit
5. I cannot regenerate the secret - there's no option to do so

This appears to be a platform bug where:
- The deactivate/reactivate process corrupted my app registration
- The portal shows "Ready For Use" but your backend rejects the credentials
- I'm locked out with no way to fix it myself

I need urgent assistance to either:
1. Fix my existing app registration in your backend
2. Force-delete my app so I can create a new one
3. Increase my app limit temporarily so I can create a working app

This is blocking all my trading automation. Please escalate this issue.

## While Waiting

You can still use the non-Schwab features:
```bash
# Test options calculations
python -c "from src.unity_wheel.math import black_scholes_price_validated; print(black_scholes_price_validated(100, 100, 0.25, 0.05, 0.2, 'call'))"

# Run risk analytics examples
python example_risk_analytics.py

# Use FRED data
python -c "from src.unity_wheel.secrets import get_ofred_api_key; print(f'FRED API Key available: {bool(get_ofred_api_key())}')"
```

## Expected Resolution Time
- Email response: 1-2 business days typically
- Phone might get immediate help
- This is a platform bug, not user error, so they should prioritize it
