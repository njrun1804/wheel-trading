# Housekeeping Complete

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up the wheel-trading project to align with v2.0 autonomous architecture. The project now has a clear, organized structure focused on **recommendation-only** operation with no broker trading integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Consolidation ✅
- **Created `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`**: Consolidated 17 integration docs into one comprehensive guide
- **Created `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`**: Merged all setup and development docs
- **Archived 30+ outdated docs** in `docs/archive/`
- **Updated README.md** to reflect new structure

### 2. File Organization ✅

├── deployment/                  # Deployment configs (NEW)
└── scripts/                     # Shell scripts
```

### 3. Files Moved ✅
- **11 example files** → `examples/` (organized by category)
- **6 test files** → `tests/`
- **20+ utility scripts** → `tools/` (organized by purpose)
- **2 deployment files** → `deployment/`

### 4. Legacy Support ✅
- Added deprecation warning to `run.py`
- Kept for backward compatibility with clear migration message

## Results

### Before:
- **60+ files** in root directory
- **30+ documentation files** with overlapping content
- Flat structure with no organization
- Mixed v1.0 and v2.0 concepts

### After:
- **14 files** in root directory (only essentials)
- **4 core documentation files** (consolidated from 34 docs)
- Clear hierarchical organization
- Aligned with v2.0 autonomous architecture
- Focus on recommendations-only (no trading execution)

### Final Root Directory:
```
CLAUDE.md                 # Claude Code instructions
DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md      # Setup & development (NEW)
HOUSEKEEPING_COMPLETE.md  # This summary
INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md      # All integrations (NEW)
Makefile                  # Build automation
QUICK_REFERENCE.md        # Common operations
README.md                 # Project overview
config.yaml               # Main configuration
my_positions.yaml         # User positions
pyproject.toml            # Python project config
requirements-dev.txt      # Dev dependencies
requirements.txt          # Core dependencies
run.py                    # Legacy (with deprecation)
run_aligned.py            # PRIMARY v2.0 entry point
```

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining import statements if needed
2. Consider removing `run.py` after deprecation period
3. Add CI/CD configuration for new structure
4. Update any external documentation/wikis

## Key Benefits

1. **70% reduction** in root directory clutter
2. **Clear separation** of concerns (examples vs tools vs core)
3. **Easier onboarding** with consolidated docs
4. **Aligned with v2.0** autonomous, recommendation-only architecture
5. **Git history preserved** for all moves

The project is now clean, organized, and ready for continued development following the v2.0 autonomous principles.
