# Update Your Cash Balance

The recommendation shows you have 25.7% cash allocation, but I used a placeholder of $50,000.

To get accurate recommendations, update `my_positions.yaml` with your actual cash balance.

**Current calculation:**
- Unity stock value: 7,500 Ã— $19.32 = $144,900
- Cash: $50,000 (placeholder)
- Total: $194,900

**To update:**
1. Check your Schwab account for available cash
2. Edit `my_positions.yaml`
3. Change the `cash:` line to your actual balance
4. Run `python get_recommendation.py` again

This will give you accurate position sizing recommendations.
