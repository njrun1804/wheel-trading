# Schwab OAuth - Confirmed Issue

## What We Know
✅ Your credentials are correct:
- App Key: OB1E7lHclAbxMCFplibjuDvQlOnmwkEN
- Secret: iIO3BpwOwIn9eLtD

✅ Schwab's OAuth services are operational

✅ App shows "Ready For Use"

❌ But Schwab returns "invalid_client" = **Their system doesn't recognize your app**

## The Problem
The deactivate/reactivate you did today appears to have broken your app registration in Schwab's backend, even though the portal shows it as active.

## Your Options

### Option 1: Create a New App (Fastest)
1. Go to https://developer.schwab.com/
2. Create a new app (name it "Github2" or similar)
3. Use the same callback URL: `https://127.0.0.1:8182/callback`
4. Once created, run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup-secrets.py
   ```
5. Enter the new credentials when prompted

### Option 2: Contact Schwab Support
Email: developer@schwab.com

Subject: App Shows Active but OAuth Returns invalid_client

My app "Github1" (App Key: OB1E7lHclAbxMCFplibjuDvQlOnmwkEN) shows as "Ready For Use" in the portal, but OAuth token exchange returns "invalid_client" error.

I deactivated and reactivated the app today (06/09/2025) to wake it up. Since then, OAuth has been broken even though the portal shows everything as normal.

The credentials are correct (I've triple-checked), and your OAuth endpoints are responding. It appears the deactivate/reactivate process corrupted my app registration in your backend.

Please either:
1. Fix my existing app registration
2. Allow me to regenerate the secret
3. Advise on next steps

This is blocking all API access for my trading automation.
```

### Option 3: Wait Until Tomorrow
Sometimes Schwab's systems need a full 24 hours to sync. Try again tomorrow morning.

## Recommendation
**Create a new app (Option 1)**. It's the fastest way to get back up and running. You can deal with the broken app later.
