# Schwab OAuth Resolution Steps

## Current Situation
- App Status: **Ready For Use** ✅
- Time: **Outside Market Hours** ✅
- Error: **invalid_client** ❌

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Verify Your Secret (Most Important!)
```bash
python verify_secret.py
```
This will check if the secret you have stored matches what's in the portal.

### 2. Check Schwab Service Status
```bash
python schwab_status_check.py
```
This will tell you if Schwab's OAuth endpoints are operational.

### 3. Test Your Credentials
```bash
python test_new_secret.py
```
This will show if Schwab recognizes your app credentials.

## If Everything Above Checks Out

Since you can't regenerate the secret in the portal, you have these options:

### Option A: Create a New App
1. Go to Schwab Developer Portal
2. Create a new app (maybe call it "Github2")
3. Use the new credentials
4. Run `python scripts/setup-secrets.py` to save them

### Option B: Contact Schwab Support
Email: developer@schwab.com

Subject: OAuth "invalid_client" Error Despite Active App

Message:
```
App Name: Github1
App Key: OB1E7lHclAbxMCFplibjuDvQlOnmwkEN
Status: Ready For Use
Issue: Getting "invalid_client" error on token exchange
Callback URL: https://127.0.0.1:8182/callback

I deactivated and reactivated my app today (06/09/2025) to wake it up.
Now OAuth token exchange fails with "invalid_client" even though the app shows as "Ready For Use" and it's been hours since market close.

Can you please:
1. Verify my app is properly activated
2. Check if there are any account restrictions
3. Provide a way to regenerate my app secret
```

### Option C: Use Alternative Features
While waiting for OAuth to work, you can still use:
- `python run.py --calculate-greeks AAPL 100 95 30 0.20`
- `python example_risk_analytics.py`
- FRED economic data analysis
- Options math calculations

## Most Likely Issue
Based on the symptoms:
1. **Secret Mismatch** - The stored secret doesn't match the portal
2. **Schwab Bug** - The deactivate/reactivate cycle broke something
3. **Missing Regenerate Button** - This might indicate a portal limitation

Run `python verify_secret.py` first - this is the most likely issue!
