## Recommendations

### Current Position
Your covered calls are slightly in-the-money. With 38 days left:
- **If bullish on Unity**: Consider rolling up and out to capture more upside
- **If neutral/bearish**: Let them ride - you'll capture the full premium if called away

### New Positions
With 25.7% cash allocation, consider:
1. **Sell cash-secured puts** on quality names
2. Target 30-45 DTE, 0.30 delta for optimal premium/risk
3. Size positions at 10-20% of portfolio per name

### Unity Specific
If your shares get called away at $25:
- You'll realize $5.68/share profit ($42,600 total)
- Plus the $1.24 premium = $6.92/share total profit
- That's a 35.8% return on your cost basis

## Action Items
1. Update `my_positions.yaml` with your actual cash balance
2. Monitor Unity - if it drops below $25, your calls will expire worthless (keeping premium)
3. If Unity continues rising, prepare to roll or let shares be called away
