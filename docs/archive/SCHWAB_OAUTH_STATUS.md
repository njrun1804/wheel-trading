# Schwab OAuth Status

## Current Situation (06/09/2025)

✅ **What's Working:**
- Your App Key (client_id) is ACTIVE and recognized by Schwab
- FRED API integration works perfectly
- Databento API integration works perfectly
- All math and risk calculations work

❌ **What's Not Working:**
- OAuth token exchange fails with "invalid_client"

## Why OAuth Is Failing

Your app was **modified today (06/09/2025)** and Schwab states:
> "App modifications are processed after market hours"

This means your updated callback URL (`https://127.0.0.1:8182/callback`) hasn't propagated through their system yet.

## What To Do

### Tomorrow Morning (06/10/2025):

Run this command:
```bash
python schwab_oauth_fixed.py
```

It should work after the overnight processing.

### If It Still Fails Tomorrow:

1. **Check your secret in Schwab Developer Portal**
   - Make sure it matches exactly what's saved
   - Your secret is 16 characters (this is correct for your app)

2. **Contact Schwab Developer Support**
   - Email: developer@schwab.com
   - Include your App Key: OB1E7lHclAbxMCFplibjuDvQlOnmwkEN
   - Mention the "invalid_client" error

### What You Can Use Now:

- Options pricing calculator
- Risk analytics (VaR, Kelly criterion)
- FRED economic data
- Databento market data (when configured)

## Your Credentials (Stored Securely)

- **App Key**: OB1E7lHclAbxMCFplibjuDvQlOnmwkEN ✅
- **Secret**: (16 characters, encrypted in ~/.wheel_trading/secrets/) ✅
- **Callback URL**: https://127.0.0.1:8182/callback ✅

## Quick Test Tomorrow

```bash
# Test if OAuth works
python schwab_oauth_fixed.py

# If successful, test everything
python scripts/test-secrets.py
```
