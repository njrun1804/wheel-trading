## ✅ Completed Simplification

All changes have been deployed locally and pushed to GitHub.

### What Changed:

1. **Removed Cloud Infrastructure**
   - ❌ Google Cloud deployment files (cloudbuild.yaml, etc.)
   - ❌ GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/)
   - ❌ Node.js dependencies (package.json)
   - ❌ Complex automation

2. **Added Simple Local Tools**
   - ✅ `run.py` - Quick CLI for trading decisions
   - ✅ Simple `Makefile` with basic commands
   - ✅ Local-only documentation
   - ✅ Streamlined requirements

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - `README.md` - Now focused on local development
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Removed cloud references
   - `LOCAL_DEV.md` - Pragmatic development guide
   - `.gitignore` - Simplified for local use

### Quick Test:

```bash
# Test the decision engine
python run.py

# Run with specific ticker
python run.py --ticker TSLA --portfolio 75000

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make format
```

### Current Status:
- **Local**: ✅ Working - 51 tests passing, 95% coverage
- **GitHub**: ✅ Pushed - All changes committed
- **Cloud**: ❌ Removed - No longer needed

### Next Steps:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
2. Add broker credentials when ready
3. Follow the incremental build plan in your prompts

The project is now optimized for single-user local development while maintaining the structure for future ML and analytics features.
