# Unity Wheel Trading Bot - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all changes made to implement a sophisticated, autonomous wheel strategy trading system for Unity (U) stock. The implementation evolved from fixing a simple date issue to creating a comprehensive analytics platform with dynamic optimization, regime detection, and safety features.

## 1. Historical Data Integration (750 Days)

### Problem
- Unity trades with extreme 77% annual volatility
- Need sufficient data for statistically valid risk calculations

### Solution
- Analyzed data requirements mathematically:
  - **250 days minimum** for basic volatility (N=250, SE=4.5%)
  - **500 days better** for regime detection (3-5 regimes)
  - **750 days optimal** for Kelly criterion stability
  - **750 days** for 95% CVaR confidence

### Implementation
- Fixed Databento integration (`pull_databento_data.py`):
  ```python
  # Weekend handling for Unity
  trade_date = date - timedelta(days=1) if date.weekday() == 6 else date

  # Correct dataset selection
  datasets_to_try = [
      ("XNYS.PILLAR", Schema.OHLCV_1D),   # NYSE Pillar
      ("DBEQ.BASIC", Schema.OHLCV_1D),    # Databento Equities
  ]
  ```
- Successfully fetched 766 days of Unity data
- Stored in DuckDB with proper schema

## 2. Regime-Aware Risk Analysis

### User Request
> "we want some sophistication on how we assess regime changes so we don't skew risk"

### Implementation (`test_regime_aware_risk.py`)
- Gaussian Mixture Model for volatility regime detection
- Identified 3 distinct regimes for Unity:
  - **Low Volatility**: 36.7% (rare)
  - **Medium Volatility**: 82.7% (current)
  - **High Volatility**: 144.3% (crisis)
- Regime-specific parameter adjustment

## 3. Dynamic Optimization System

### User Preference
> "I prefer dynamic variables vs tiers"

### Implementation (`src/unity_wheel/analytics/dynamic_optimizer.py`)
- Continuous parameter adjustment (not discrete tiers)
- Direct optimization of objective function: **CAGR - 0.20 × |CVaR₉₅|**
- Smooth transitions based on market state:
  ```python
  # Volatility adjustment (continuous)
  vol_adjustment = -0.15 * (state.volatility_percentile - 0.5)

  # Momentum adjustment (smooth)
  momentum_adjustment = 0.05 * np.tanh(state.price_momentum * 10)

  # IV rank adjustment (gradual)
  if state.iv_rank:
      iv_adjustment = 0.03 * ((state.iv_rank - 50) / 50)
  ```
- Monte Carlo validation (10,000 simulations)

## 4. Comprehensive Analytics Suite

### User Request

- ML-based detection (Isolation Forest)
- Market microstructure analysis
- Corporate action detection
- Multi-factor anomaly scoring

#### D. Seasonality Detector (`seasonality.py`)
- Day-of-week effects
- Monthly patterns (turn-of-month, mid-month)
- Quarterly earnings cycles
- Annual patterns (tax loss, year-end)
- Gaming industry specific patterns

#### E. Integrated Decision Engine (`decision_engine.py`)
- Orchestrates all components
- 12-step decision process:
  1. Calculate market state
  2. Run dynamic optimization
  3. Analyze IV surface
  4. Check for events
  5. Detect anomalies
  6. Apply seasonality
  7. Integrate all factors
  8. Determine action
  9. Find best option
  10. Calculate position size
  11. Compute risk metrics
  12. Generate warnings
- Produces comprehensive `WheelRecommendation`

## 5. Safety and Monitoring Features

### Performance Tracker (`performance_tracker.py`)
- Records all recommendations
- Tracks predicted vs actual outcomes
- Identifies confidence miscalibration
- Suggests parameter improvements
- SQLite database for persistence

### Risk Limits (`risk/limits.py`)
- Hard safety limits:
  - Max 20% portfolio per position
  - Max 10 contracts per trade
  - Stop after 3 consecutive losses
  - No trading >150% volatility
  - Minimum 30% confidence required
- Daily P&L tracking
- Time-based restrictions

### Daily Health Check (`src/unity_wheel/monitoring/scripts/daily_health_check.py`)
- Morning system verification:
  - Data freshness check
  - Configuration validation
  - Credential verification
  - Performance review
  - Component testing

### Live Monitor (`src/unity_wheel/monitoring/scripts/live_monitor.py`)
- Real-time dashboard
- Updates every 10 seconds
- Shows:
  - Current market data
  - Risk status
  - Performance metrics
  - Active alerts
- Opportunity detection

## 6. Integration and Testing

### Test Results
- Successfully processed 766 days of Unity data
- Detected medium volatility regime (82.7%)
- Generated autonomous recommendation:
  - Action: SELL_PUT
  - Delta: 0.196 (conservative due to high vol)
  - DTE: 21 days (shortened due to Fed meeting)
  - Kelly: 50% (Half-Kelly as designed)
  - Confidence: 88.2%

### Key Achievements
1. **Autonomous Operation**: Fully self-contained decision making
2. **Dynamic Optimization**: Continuous parameter adjustment
3. **Risk Awareness**: Multiple safety layers
4. **Full Explainability**: Every decision justified
5. **Performance Tracking**: Learn from outcomes
