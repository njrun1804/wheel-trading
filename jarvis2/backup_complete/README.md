# Jarvis 2.0 - Intelligent Meta-Coder

An AI-powered code generation system that learns and evolves, optimized for Apple M4 Pro hardware.

## Features

- **Neural-Guided MCTS**: Uses neural networks to guide Monte Carlo Tree Search for intelligent code exploration
- **Diversity Engine**: Generates 100+ diverse solutions using AlphaCode 2-style approaches
- **Continuous Learning**: Learns from every execution to improve over time
- **Hardware Optimized**: Fully utilizes M4 Pro's 12 CPU cores, 20 GPU cores, and 24GB unified memory
- **Multi-Index System**: 
  - FAISS for semantic search
  - SQLite FTS5 for text search
  - NetworkX for dependency graphs
  - DuckDB for analytics
  - LMDB for ultra-fast lookups

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode
./launch_jarvis.sh

# Single query
./launch_jarvis.sh -q "optimize this sorting algorithm"

# High-quality mode (more simulations)
./launch_jarvis.sh -s 5000 -v 200 -q "complex refactoring task"
```

## How It Works

1. **Understand**: Uses pre-built indexes to instantly understand context
2. **Explore**: Runs thousands of parallel MCTS simulations guided by neural networks
3. **Diversify**: Generates 100+ variants across different dimensions
4. **Evaluate**: Assesses solutions on performance, readability, correctness, and resources
5. **Learn**: Stores experiences and continuously improves

## Performance

- **<5ms** filesystem search (100x faster than MCP)
- **2000** parallel MCTS simulations on GPU
- **100+** diverse solutions per query
- **Continuous** background learning

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Apple M4 Pro (or compatible Apple Silicon)
- 8GB+ free memory recommended

## Configuration

Create a `jarvis_config.json`:

```json
{
  "max_parallel_simulations": 2000,
  "gpu_batch_size": 256,
  "num_diverse_solutions": 100,
  "use_all_cores": true
}
```

## The Future

Jarvis 2.0 represents a new paradigm in code generation - treating it as an intelligent search problem in a vast possibility space, guided by neural networks and continuous learning.
