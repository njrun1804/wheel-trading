# Data Quality Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Summary
The data quality assessment revealed what appeared to be catastrophic issues (82.8% "duplicates"), but investigation showed this was actually **intraday data that needed aggregation to daily OHLCV**.

## Root Cause
The ETL process loaded intraday/tick-level data from Databento but failed to aggregate it to daily bars. Each intraday price update was stored as a separate "daily" record.

## Evidence
1. **43,666 options had exactly 1 row** - These were illiquid options with only one trade per day
2. **Liquid options had many rows** - Up to 95 intraday prices for heavily traded options
3. **All OHLC relationships were valid** - No High < Low or other impossible prices
4. **Price ranges made sense** - Options showed realistic intraday price movement

## Resolution
Successfully aggregated 1,040,215 intraday records to 178,724 daily OHLCV records:
- **Open**: First trade of the day
- **High**: Maximum price of the day
- **Low**: Minimum price of the day
- **Close**: Last trade of the day
- **Volume**: Sum of all trades

## Current Status
✅ **Data is now suitable for production use**
- Proper daily OHLCV format
- No duplicates
- All price relationships valid
- Ready for wheel strategy analysis

## Remaining Gaps
Still need to address:
1. **Unity stock price history** - Required for risk calculations
2. **FRED data** - Risk-free rates
3. **Greeks calculations** - Can now be computed with clean options data

## Lesson Learned
When working with market data providers like Databento, always verify the data granularity and implement proper aggregation for your use case. The data source was trustworthy - the issue was in our processing.
