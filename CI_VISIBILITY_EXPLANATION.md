# Why You Don't See the New CI in GitHub Actions

## The Issue
The new simple `ci.yml` workflow is in PR #110 but not running because:
1. **GitHub only runs workflows that exist in the default branch (main)**
2. **New workflows in PRs don't run until merged**

## Current State
```
main branch:         Has old complex workflows (5 files)
PR #110 branch:      Has new simple workflow (1 file)
GitHub Actions:      Only sees what's in main
```

## The Solution
Once PR #110 is merged to main:
1. Old workflows will be deleted
2. New simple CI will become active
3. You'll see it in GitHub Actions tab

## What Happens Next
After merging PR #110:
- ✅ Simple CI workflow becomes active
- ✅ Only 1 workflow instead of 5
- ✅ Runs on every push/PR to main
- ✅ Takes ~2-3 minutes (tests + security checks)

This is normal GitHub behavior - it's a security feature to prevent malicious workflows in PRs.
